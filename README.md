<h2>Topic:-Difference between hard water and soft water</h2>

|Hardwater|Softwater|
|---|---|
|Water which does not form lather with soap is called Hard water|Water which forms lather easily with soap is called soft water|
|Hardwater has dissolved salts of ca and mg.|Softwater does not have dissolved salts of ca and mg|
|Because of presence of impurities,boiling temperature,of water is increased,because of which a lot of time go water for heating |Less time and fuel is consumed for heating softwater|
|Because of presence of impurities lot of soap is consumed by hardwater|Softwater consumes less soap for washing and bathing purposes |

<h2>Methods to remove permanent hardness</h2>
**There are three methods to remove permanent hardness**
<h3>Lime-Soda:-</h3>The method involves the treatment of water with lime[Ca(OH)2] and soda [Na2(CO)3] which reasults in the formation of insoluble precipitates of Ca and Mg which can be removed by filtration.

|(A)Cold lime soda process|(B)Hot lime soda process|
|---|---|
|It is carried out at room temperature.It is a low process.Coagulant Al2(SO4)3 is added .Dissolved gases are not not removed. Water obtained is not very soft.The hardness content in water is around 60ppm.|It is carried out at high temperature almost at b.pt.of water .It is fast process.No need of coagulant.Dissolved gases are removed.Water obtained is soft of hardness 15-20ppm|
<h3>Zeolite or Permutit process:-</h3>This is a very effective method.Chemical formula of zeolite is:-Na2O.Al2O3. xSiO2. yH2O;where x=2-10,y=2-6
Hydrated sodium alumino silicate or sodium zeolite.
Permanent hardness of water can be removed by permutit process. Permutite is an artifical zeolite used for softening of water. Through ion-exchange process, here cation-anion exchange chamber is used to obtain pure water. In calgon's process sodium hexa meta phosphate is used to soften the water.

<h3>Ion exchange or de-ionization process:-</h3>Ion-exchange or Deionization or Demineralization Process - Recently ion-exchange resins have been used to remove all minerals from water. It is a process by which ions held on a porous, essentially insoluble solid are exchanged for ions in solution that is brought in contact with it.
Ion-exchange Resin – An ion-exchange resin is a crosslinked organic polymer network having some ionisable group. It may be of two types depending upon the nature of the ionizable group.

(i) Cation Exchange Resin or Cation Exchanger - Such resins have - SO3H, -- COOH or -OH (phenolic) group as the ionizable group. Since these resins exchange the cationic portion of minerals by their hydrogen atom, they are known as cation exchangers.

(ii) Anion Exchange Resin or Anion Exchanger – These resins have -NH2, -NHCH3, -N(CH3)2 or -OH group. They exchange the anionic portion of the minerals and they are known as anion exchanger.
Uses of Ion-exchange Resin – Water treatment by ion-exchange resin includes softening deionization and de-alkalization of water. Therefore, hard water can be converted into soft water by making use of ion-exchange resins.
